### Three-Ginger Cookie Dough
_Makes 16 cookies_

**Ingredients**
- 227g unsalted butter, room temperature (2 sticks)
- 220g dark brown sugar (1 cup packed)
- 100g granulated sugar (1/2 cup)
- 100g large egg (2 medium)
- 7g vanilla extract (1 1/2 teaspoons)
- 43g molasses (2 tablespoons)
- 240g bread flour (2 cups)
- 2g baking powder (1/2 teaspoon)
- 1.5g baking soda (1/4 teaspoon)

- 200g Spiced Ginger Crumb

**Process**
1. Cream butter and sugars in stand mixer with paddle attachment on medium-high for 3 minutes (will vary based on butter temperature).
2. Scrape down sides of bowl, add egg, vanilla, and molasses. Beat with the paddle attachment for 7-8 minutes until very light and fluffy. Periodically scrape down the sides if necessary.
3. Reduce speed to low. Add flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and all spices. Mix just until dough comes together, about 30 seconds. You may need to scrape down the sides during this.
4. Add Spiced Ginger Crumb and mix just until incorporated, about 10 seconds.

### Assembly
1. Using a 2 3/4 oz cookie scoop (about 1/3 cup), portion dough onto parchment-lined sheet pans.
2. Pat tops of cookie dough flat and sprinkle with reserved ground crumb mixture.
3. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight (minimum 1 hour), up to 1 week.
4. Heat oven to 350°F.
5. Arrange chilled cookies minimum 4 inches apart on parchment-lined sheet pans. Approx 4 cookies on a half-sheet pan works well.
6. Bake, one sheet at a time, 15-17 minutes until edges are lightly browned but centers are still slightly soft.
7. While cookies are still warm (but not hot), sprinkle with a tiny pinch of ground black pepper.
8. Cool completely on sheet pans or a rack.
9. Dust very lightly with fresh ground pepper before serving.
